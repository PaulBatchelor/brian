How to make a new sketch for briandb. Really loose notes.

- Build the sketch. Put it in brian/sktch
- Open up brian/db/sketches.c 
- If you aren't making a metasketch, the automated script does
most of the work. In vim. run :r !sh brian/db/mk_sktch.sh your_sketch_path.sp
- Re-order SQL commands in comment (should be fixed later)
- Replace "foo" with the name of your sketch: the function, SQL statement,
The two SQL commands, the struct entry
- In the comment generated, remove the last common in the SQL statement
- In the struct entry, make sure the function and sketch name are
correct
- Select the SQL commands in vim in visual mode. run !sqlite3 brian/brian.db
If all succeeds, they will disappear without fuss
- Place struct entry at second-to-last position (NULL is always last)
- Go into brian/db and recompile with "make"
- Use a test file and insert the JSON data from your sketch in the
following way: r !sporth -n your_sketch_path.sp
- test out briandb: ./brian/db/briandb your_test.json brian/brian.db
- if all went well.. verify with sqlite. 
- remove bogus entries
- add new sketch to brian/sktch/sktch.txt
- add new files to git and commit
